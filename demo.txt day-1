HTTP is a network delay sensitive protocol in the sense that if there is less network delay, then the page loads faster. However, an impressive increase in network bandwidth only slightly improves page load time. This is key to understanding the differences in performance efficiencies between the different versions of HTTP. Back in the day when people used dial up modems web pages were simple and it was the actual data transfer between the server and the client that contributed towards the largest chunk of the page load time. Today the actual downloading of resources from server takes a negligible portion of the total page load time due to the tremendous increase in bandwidth availability. It is the time taken to establish the TCP connection and making requests that impacts performance. It was initially recommended to use only two connections per hostname but today most browsers use six connections per hostname.
